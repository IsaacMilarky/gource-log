## Core Team

An up-to-date list of core team members can be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). At this time, the project is still building the core team and defining roles and responsibilities. We are eagerly seeking individuals who would like to join the community and help us define and fill these roles.

# Development and Software Delivery Lifecycle 

The following guide is for members of the project team who have access to the repository as well as code contributors. The main difference between internal and external contributions is that external contributors will need to fork the project and will not be able to merge their own pull requests. For more information on contributing, see: [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Local Development

<!--- TODO - with example below:
This project is monorepo with several apps. Please see the [api](./api/README.md) and [frontend](./frontend/README.md) READMEs for information on spinning up those projects locally. Also see the project [documentation](./documentation) for more info.
-->

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

    `git clone https://github.com/IsaacMilarky/gource-log.git`

2. Install the required packages and build dependencies:

    - Docker
    - act
    - gource
    
## Running Locally

1. Change to the base project directory

2. Run the 'build' job using act

    `sudo act -a build`

## Coding Style and Linters


This project adheres to PEP8 rules and guidelines whenever possible when accepting
new contributions of Python code. Although, there are good reasons to ignore particular guidelines
in particular situations. Further information on PEP8 can be found [here.](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

This project utilizes pylint as the primary linter for backend code, while eslint and prettier handle code formatting and linting for the frontend. Checks are implemented upon new pull requests into protected branches to ensure code quality and consistency.

Python code quality checks are extremely useful for lowering the
cost of maintenence of Python projects. Further information on Pylint can be found [here.](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Branching Model

We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

1.  Fork the project 
2.  Check out the `main` branch 
3.  Create a feature branch
4.  Write code and tests for your change 
5.  From your branch, make a pull request against `dev` if you have a feature change and `main` if it is a hotfix 
6.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed and resolve git history if needed
7.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `dev` and later released into `main`
8.  Delete your feature branch

This project follows [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), which means:

* Make small changes in [short-lived feature branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/) and merge to `dev` frequently.
* Be open to submitting multiple small pull requests for a single ticket (i.e. reference the same ticket across multiple pull requests).
* Treat each change you merge to `dev` and `main` as immediately deployable to production. Do not merge changes that depend on subsequent changes you plan to make, even if you plan to make those changes shortly.
* Ticket any unfinished or partially finished work.
* Tests should be written for changes introduced, and adhere to the text percentage threshold determined by the project.

This project uses **continuous deployment** using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) which is configured in the [./github/worfklows](.github/workflows) directory.

Pull-requests are merged to `main` and the changes are immediately deployed to the development environment. Releases are created to push changes to production.

## Community

The gource-log team is taking a community-first and open source approach to the product development of this tool. We believe government software should be made in the open and be built and licensed such that anyone can download the code, run it themselves without paying money to third parties or using proprietary software, and use it as they will.

We know that we can learn from a wide variety of communities, including those who will use or will be impacted by the tool, who are experts in technology, or who have experience with similar technologies deployed in other spaces. We are dedicated to creating forums for continuous conversation and feedback to help shape the design and development of the tool.

We also recognize capacity building as a key part of involving a diverse open source community. We are doing our best to use accessible language, provide technical and process documents, and offer support to community members with a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets.
